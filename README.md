# UnLeSS-Project
This project contains dataset collected by scattering RF sensors within a house and collecting the RSS with a person is moving around the house on a predetermined path in order to use the collected RSS data to develop a localization system able to track the moving person.

Plot1:
 RSS  for  one  of  the  links  with  highlighted  crossing periods for both the modeled predicted and the UnLeSS predicted  crossings  while  imposing  constraints  on  the  transition probabilities 
 
 Plot2:
 The radio tomographic image with sensors (•), actual position of the person (X), estimated position of the person (O)
 
 Plot3:
 Affected links (—-), sensors (•) actual position of the person (X)
